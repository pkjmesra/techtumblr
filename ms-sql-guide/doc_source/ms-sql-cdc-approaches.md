# Primer on CDC Strategy in MS SQL Guide

## Purpose
The purpose of this guide is to approach a common business problem of tracking changes to the tables in SQL server. 

There could be use cases where an impact in one system needs to be propagated to another system in the business ecosystem. 
For example, new users on-boarding into a service providerâ€™s server requires a confirmation via an email or a sms. Such notification handlers may already be part of another system and there arises a need for the communication between the core system and notification system which we usually achieve by an event driven mechanism. 
Similarly another use case could be where we need to synchronize two system servers for a certain business need. 
We have more than one way to approach this kind of business requirement and this primer which will help us get started.


## Approach 1: Application sends changed information to an event b	us.

1. In this approach, as soon as an application service writes (insert, update, delete) into tables to be captured, the same application also publishes an event into an event bus. The event may just contain unique id of the record, the operation(op) and timestamp of op. 
Alternatively, one may approach publishing the entire row if there is no need to join data from other tables. It will depend on your specific requirement.
2. A SyncApp (a custom built transformation tool) is subscribed to an event bus.
3. The SyncApp processes the events and may read back into SQL tables for all other related data.

This is a straightforward approach. However, your business may not be so open ended but may be constrained by different circumstances.  For example, the application service may not belong to your team and you may not have access to modify the application to inject the code for publishing into the event bus. The other constraints could be that the table update may happen from more than one workflow in a legacy application which may be unknown to the existing team. The existing team could be risk-averse and does not allow us to touch the application code.

In such cases, following approaches addresses capturing the changes off the SQL server.


## Approach 2: SQL Database Trigger

![\[Diagram for approach 2: CDC with DB trigger\]](https://github.com/surbhi-nijhara/techtumblr/blob/master/ms-sql-guide/diag_source/ms-sql-cdc-db-trigger.jpg?raw=true)

1. In this approach, the application writes  (insert, update, delete)  into the tables to be captured.
Triggers are created for the tables to be tracked. The trigger gets the id, operation and timestamp into a table  say CDC_CapturedTable.
2. A scheduled cron job fetches the changed data into CDC_CapturedTable table and publishes an event.
3. The sync app on receiving the event processes as required.


Since database triggers are synchronous and it adds some latency to the business transaction, go for this approach if the business SLA can endure any additional delay. This strategy can be chosen if the changes to the table are not frequent or the workflow transaction does not meet hard SLA requirements.
Lets see next approach.


## Approach 3: SQL CDC

![\[Diagram for approach 3: CDC with SQL CDC\]](https://github.com/surbhi-nijhara/techtumblr/blob/master/ms-sql-guide/diag_source/ms-sql-cdc-cdc.jpg?raw=true)

1. Similar to approach 2, the application writes (insert, update, delete) into the tables to be captured.
2. CDC is enabled at DB and table level using system stored procedure sys.sp_cdc_enable_db and sys.sp_cdc_enable_table respectively.
This creates asynchronous triggers for the tables to be tracked. Under the hood, a change capture instance is created and iys capture process works off the transaction logs asynchronously.
3. The capture process intrinsically gets the id, operation and timestamp into a table say CDC.CapturedTable.
4. A scheduled custom job polls for the changed information from CDC_CapturedTable using appropriate system stored procedures like dc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_{capture_instance}. The scheduled custom job stored procedure receives the data and inserts into another table say Processor_CapturedTable.
5. A second scheduled cron job now polls for the non-processed changed information data into Processor_CapturedTable, publishes an event and marks the row as processed.
6. The sync app on receiving the event processes as required.

As we see here in step 3 and 4, there arises a need to create an additional job and a table because  SQL CDC mechanism captures the changes into a system table. 
One of the straight forward strategies to track the status of the processed rows is to set a flag in an additional column. Since CDC.apturedTable is a system table, its data will need to be taken into another table here i.e.Processor_CapturedTable where each row can be marked as processed.  Additionally, the custom scheduled SQL job is needed to be built scu that it selectively access the new data captured.

Summary of this approach is that
CDC is an asynchronous capture of changes from the transaction log.
The pipeline to publish an event involves two polling jobs and creation of additional user tables.

## Approach 4: SQL Server Broker Service (SSSB)

![\[Diagram for approach 4: CDC with SQL SSB\]](https://github.com/surbhi-nijhara/techtumblr/blob/master/ms-sql-guide/diag_source/ms-sql-cdc-sssb.jpg?raw=true)

1. Similar to approach 2 or 3, the application writes (insert, update, delete) into the tables to be captured. 
2. In this approach, SQL Service Broker is enabled and SQL broker objects viz Message Types, Contracts, Queues, Services, Trigger can be created and configured via a stable  .NET Library - SqlTableDepenency
3. SQL broker uses an external application as its activation procedure. The external application here is SyncApp.
4. The syncApp gets notified that a message is ready to be processed which then takes it ahead as explained in previous approaches.

More details are here at [SQL Server Broker Service (SSSB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-service-broker?view=sql-server-ver15)

Summary of this approach is that it provides 
+ SQL Native Asynchronous framework
+ It is reliable and scalable
+ Since it operates within SQL, it is faster.
+ Users need not implement the low level code to create and configure the SQL broker objects but use the NuGet library to avoid the boilerplate. User only needs to write handler logic after the event is received.

An argument could be that enabling SSSB and having SQL Server now perform additional mechanism of all that it goes into creation of all SQL broker objects like messages, queues, services, contracts etc., followed up by execution of this additional internal messaging mechanism, may impact the overall performance of SQL synchronous business transactions under pressure test.

Checking with folks who have used SQL have given mixed feedback. For some, there has been no performance impact seen even when they have used service broker in uses cases like and that too data warehouse on a low configuration server. 
Performance benefits can also be read in detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008/dd576261(v=sql.100).
